Help me create a new service for the Blackfish platform.

The service name is: $ARGUMENTS

Guide me through creating:
1. Service class in `lib/src/blackfish/server/services/` extending `BaseService`
2. API routes in `lib/src/blackfish/server/asgi.py`
3. CLI commands in `lib/src/blackfish/cli/services/`
4. Frontend page in `web/app/{service-name}/`
5. Tests for the new service

First, examine the existing services (text_generation, speech_recognition) to understand the patterns, then create the new service following those patterns.
