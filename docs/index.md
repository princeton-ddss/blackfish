# Welcome to Blackfish!
Blackfish is an open source "AI-as-a-Service" (AIaaS) platform that helps researchers
use state-of-the-art, open source ML/AI models. With Blackfish, researchers can spin up
their own equivalent of popular public cloud AI services (e.g., Amazon Transcribe) using
high-performance computing (HPC) resources already available on their campus.[^1]

## How does Blackfish work?


## Requirements
Blackfish requires either Python *or* Docker installed to run on a desktop/laptop. Blackfish
can also be installed as a "no code" solution: ask your HPC system administrators about
[enabling Blackfish through OnDemand]().

## Acknowledgements
Blackfish is developed by research software engineers at Princeton University's
Data Driven Social Science Initiative.
